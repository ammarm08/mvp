There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Graffiti.IO

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Read the liner notes while listening to your favorite band.

## Summary ##
  > Graffiti.IO is for people who can't multitask between listening to the music and listening to the lyrics.
  Enter an artist, select a song, and hit play. Liner notes + annotations will periodically pop up to give you more context about the song.

## Problem ##
  > Music isn't just about the beat, and it isn't just about the lyrics. Unfortunately, some goldfish-minded people like the Graffit.IO founder can't pay attention to both at the same time. This app gives the perpetual head-nodders and beat-rockers a chance to see what the song is about without needing to pay very careful attention to the lyrics.

## Solution ##
  > As a song is playing, Graffiti.IO will periodically serve up an annotation or description that has been highly upvoted on the Genius.com platform. That's it.

## Quote from You ##
  > "Our product is really just an integration of alot of cool things already out there. While our current beta product is limited to just annotations pulled from Genius, our long-term goal is to build out interactivity similar to the real-time commenting of Periscope livestreams."

## How to Get Started ##
  > 1. Enter an artist. 2. Pick a song. 3. Hit play.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "This is the new-age vinyl listening session. On rainy Friday nights, I call my friends over, order in some bomb-ass pad thai, put this shit on my projector screen, and we literally 'watch' the music and talk about it."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Take Graffiti.IO for a test ride at graffitiIO.herokuapp.com
